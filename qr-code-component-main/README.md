## Overview

I haven't coded in HTML and CSS in a long time, so this project helped me get back in the workflow and start learning new stuff. This was relatively simple to do.

## My process
 1. Did the HTML first
 2. Made the holder div
 3. Added the image
 4. Made the title
 5. Made the paragraph
 6. Then CSS styling.
 7. Used flexbox to align the holder div to the center
 8. Used flexbox *inside* the holder div to align everything to the center.
 9. Used CSS to change the fonts and the image size. The end result was small enough to be able to fit on most phones with no extra code for responsiveness.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learn things so much as recap things I knew before. This just helped me find my groove and got me excited for front end development again.
