### What I learned

I really came to grips with flexbox when making this project. A lot of objects had to be up in wrapper divs in order to align them properly, and I had to use flex properties to do just that. For example, the price and time div needed to be a flex div with ```justify-content: space-between;``` in order for it to align well.

The hover effect for the image also required me to learn how absolute and relative positioning works. I don't know the full details yet, but I'd like to learn!
